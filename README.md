# LÖVE Sokoban

This project is a clone of the classic Sokoban game, written using the LÖVE 2D framework. Sokoban is a type of transport puzzle, in which the player pushes boxes or crates around in a warehouse, trying to get them to storage locations. This clone aims to replicate the original gameplay and provide a similar experience, leveraging the capabilities of the LÖVE 2D framework.
